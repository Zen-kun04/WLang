# üíª WLang - The programming language for the web

WLang is a programming language designed to unify web syntaxes in a single language, thus simplifying web development!

---

## üìñ Why?
In February 2023 to January 2024 I was learning web development, from basics to advanced topics. To be honest, almost everything was kind of "easy" to learn and practice.

But I knew several people trying to learn web development but it's too difficult, and I can understand them because the web languages are divided into several sintaxis.

For example, here is a list of web languages with different sintaxis or concepts:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP
- TypeScript (slight)
- Angular
- React.js
- Next.js

You get it, if you want to become a web developer you have to learn at least 3 or 4 different sintaxis.

But here is WLang (as a prototype for the moment). THE language that will centralize all those sintaxis in only one to simplify the web development but with the same features.

## üì• Installation  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Download** the installer from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Zen-kun04/WLang/releases)

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Open the installer.** This will install the transpiler

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Ready!** Installation is complete!

---

## ü§ñ Commands

`wlang compile [directory]` -> Convert all the `.wl` files into web files (like .html) recursively.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Examples

Here you will find some examples of how Wlang works, the index.wl file will be our code that later will be converted to our index.html

---

```wl

// File: index.wl

// Main content of the page
main() {

    // Add a level-1 heading with the text "WLang"
    h1("This is a level-1 heading tag");

    // Add a paragraph describing the language
    p("This is a paragraph");
}
```
This will return an index.html:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a level-1 heading tag</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
</body>

</html>
<!-- Made with <3 using WLang -->
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Complete example

```wl

// File: index.wl

head() {
    // Set the page language to French
    page.setLang("fr");

    // Set the page title displayed in the browser tab
    page.setTitle("WLang Website");
}

// Main content of the page
main() {
    // Add a level-1 heading with the text "WLang"
    heading1("WLang");

    // Add a paragraph describing the language
    paragraph("The programming language for the web");
}

// Footer section with a link
footer() {
    // Add a clickable link to the GitHub repository
    url("https://github.com/Zen-kun04/WLang", "GitHub");
}
```

This will return an index.html:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="fr">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>WLang Website</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>WLang</h1>
<p>The programming language for the web</p>
</body>
<footer>
<a href="https://github.com/Zen-kun04/WLang">GitHub</a>
</footer>
</html>
<!-- Made with <3 using WLang -->
```

## Reusable Components
File: index.wl
```wl
head() {
    page.setLang("fr");
    page.setTitle("WLang Website with Components");
}

comp MyComponent {
    paragraph("This is a paragraph used in a reusable component");
    p("Another paragraph but using the p() function!");
    paragraph("WLang components are very cool!!!");
}

main() {
    heading1("WLang");
    paragraph("Using Components!");
    MyComponent;
    MyComponent;
}

footer() {
    url("https://github.com/Zen-kun04/WLang", "GitHub");
}
```

File: index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="fr">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>WLang Website with Components</title>
</head>

<body>
    <main>
        <h1>WLang</h1>
        <p>Using Components!</p>
        <p>This is a paragraph used in a reusable component</p>
        <p>Another paragraph but using the p() function!</p>
        <p>WLang components are very cool!!!</p>
        <p>This is a paragraph used in a reusable component</p>
        <p>Another paragraph but using the p() function!</p>
        <p>WLang components are very cool!!!</p>
    </main>
</body>
<footer>
    <a href="https://github.com/Zen-kun04/WLang">GitHub</a>
</footer>
